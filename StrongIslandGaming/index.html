                        <br>
                        Why is this one card worth so much? Error cards are some the most valuable of all Pokémon cards, and some of the holographic base sets have a rare error. These cards, known as "Shadowless," are noticeably missing a shadow to the right of the image.
                        <br>
                        This error was remedied rather quickly, so not many of these cards exist. Couple that with the fact that a holographic Charizard was every kid's dream, and you've got a pretty darn valuable piece of paper in your hands.

                        <br>
                        Published on April 18, 1938 (cover-dated June), by National Allied Publications, a corporate predecessor of DC Comics, it is considered the first true superhero comic; and though today Action Comics is a monthly title devoted to Superman, it began, like many early comics, as an anthology.
                        <br>
                        Action Comics was started by publisher Jack Liebowitz. The first issue had a print run of 200,000 copies, which promptly sold out, although it took some time for National to realize that the "Superman" strip was responsible for sales of the series that would soon approach 1,000,000 a month. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were paid $10 per page, for a total of $130 for their work on this issue. Liebowitz would later say that selecting Superman to run in Action Comics #1 was "pure accident" based on deadline pressure and that he selected a "thrilling" cover, depicting Superman lifting a car over his head.

                        <br>
                        The most bloody-handed and savage of the Emperor’s gene-forged sons is the Primarch Angron, whose legendary reputation in battle has earned him the title of The Undefeated amongst his brothers. Cast in his youth upon a world of brutal  oppression, he was enslaved and surgically mutilated to become a gladiator in its games of death, eventually becoming the undefeated lord of the red sands, a killer without peer.
                        <br>
                        When he rebelled against his brutal overlords, the Emperor saved Angron from certain death alongside his loyal followers, an act Angron has never forgiven the Emperor for. It is little surprise then that when his brother Primarch Horus turned against the Emperor that Angron was quick to side with the traitorous Warmaster; his only true master though was ever his rage and bloodlust..
                        <br>
                        This model is already assembled and painted.
