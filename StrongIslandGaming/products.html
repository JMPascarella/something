                            <em>Collectible Charizard Pokémon Card: 4/102, Holo, Holofoil, Base Set, MP; GRADED 8/10;</em>
                            <br>
                            Why is this one card worth so much? Error cards are some the most valuable of all Pokémon cards, and some of the
                            holographic base sets have a rare error. These cards, known as "Shadowless," are noticeably missing a shadow to the
                            right of the image.
                            <br>
                            This error was remedied rather quickly, so not many of these cards exist. Couple that with the fact that a holographic
                            Charizard was every kid's dream, and you've got a pretty darn valuable piece of paper in your hands.

                            <em>Action Comics #1; Graded 8.5/10; RARE;</em>
                            <br>
                            Published on April 18, 1938 (cover-dated June), by National Allied Publications, a corporate predecessor of DC Comics,
                            it is considered the first true superhero comic; and though today Action Comics is a monthly title devoted to Superman,
                            it began, like many early comics, as an anthology.
                            <br>
                            Action Comics was started by publisher Jack Liebowitz. The first issue had a print run of 200,000 copies, which promptly
                            sold out, although it took some time for National to realize that the "Superman" strip was responsible for sales of the
                            series that would soon approach 1,000,000 a month. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were paid $10 per page, for a total of
                            $130 for their work on this issue. Liebowitz would later say that selecting Superman to run in Action Comics #1 was
                            "pure accident" based on deadline pressure and that he selected a "thrilling" cover, depicting Superman lifting a car
                            over his head.

                            <br>
                            The most bloody-handed and savage of the Emperor’s gene-forged sons is the Primarch Angron, whose legendary reputation
                            in battle has earned him the title of The Undefeated amongst his brothers. Cast in his youth upon a world of brutal
                            oppression, he was enslaved and surgically mutilated to become a gladiator in its games of death, eventually becoming
                            the undefeated lord of the red sands, a killer without peer.
                            <br>
                            When he rebelled against his brutal overlords, the Emperor saved Angron from certain death alongside his loyal
                            followers, an act Angron has never forgiven the Emperor for. It is little surprise then that when his brother Primarch
                            Horus turned against the Emperor that Angron was quick to side with the traitorous Warmaster; his only true master
                            though was ever his rage and bloodlust..

                <h1>-- Third Party Grading --</h1>
                <p>Strong Island Gaming is partnered with CGC, the world's leading comic book and trading card grading service!</p>
                <p>These are the things that are taken into consideration when grading your comics and cards:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rarity is how unusual or how easily replaced the comic book might be. You will be less inclined to part with a rare
                        comic book easily, and rarity increases value.</li>
                        <li>Singularity is whether the seller has more than one copy. If it's your only copy of a particular comic book, you might
                        be less inclined to part with it easily.</li>   
                        <li>Contribution addresses how the comic book fits into a collection. For example, do you have a full run of the title, or
                        is this a Donald Duck book in a sea of Avengers? A comic book that is part of a run of comics makes a bigger
                        contribution to the whole collection.</li>
                        <li>Sentiment is that intangible quality that links you to your comic books and comes from your love of the artform.
                        Sentiment is never an issue for comic book speculators, only for comic book collectors, or for people who have inherited
                        comic books from a loved one.</li>
                        <li>Marketability looks at the potential buyers available for your comic books. The Internet has changed many of the rules
                        that dictate your market. Online auctions, e-classifieds, and other potential sales sites mean that your comic books
                        have a much better chance of finding a buyer today than ever before.</li>
                    </ul>
