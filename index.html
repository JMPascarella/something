                <p>We all have to start somewhere. I listen to a few podcasts, most are hobby related (related to my hobby that is) but I listen to a few having to do with coding and technology. One of them, CodeNewbies, stressed how important it can be to keep your own blog. Not only to record your own thoughts and your journey but to also document what you were coding and how you went about building it. Most lists I've seen have "Learning how to google" pretty much in their top-five most usefull tools a coder can have. One or two had it as number one. And to go back to CodeNewbies, they talked about how, by documenting a problem you were having (say, for example, getting a flexbox to center properly on the page) and then <em>documenting how you went about finding the solution and then implementing that solution</em> you eventually want your blog to become one of the top search results for that issue in the future. Now, I don't expect myself to become one of Google's top searches, but I have always enjoyed journaling and I like the idea of taking this blog and building it into a "live resume", so to speak. To buildd it up with some personal content, link my github as well as some other resources that I use and then go from there. Even if no one reads this but me, it will still be a useful tool for me to have and to build.</p>
                <p>Now with that being said.... Getting this website formated to my liking, syncing it up to my github desktop app and having it work correctly through github pages was a nightmare. At first I was going to style it from scratch, but then I went and looked at some of the Jekyll themes and so I was going to use one of those. After about an hour I FINALLY got the theme to load correctly but I wasnt't having it at that point (plus, actually going online and updating the site seemed to be a bigger pain that just updating the .html and then pushing it to github), so I decided on a medium of the two: I used Jekyll's "hacker" theme as a base and then I put some personal styling into it on my own.</p>
                <p>As far as I'm concerned, I'm currently in my third month of study at a Long Island tech school for Web Development. It's not a bootcamp since it goes from May 2019 until December 2019 but it is pretty intensive. So far we've completed the modules for HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. To be honest, I feel I have a pretty good grasp on HTML5, I'm pretty confident in my CSS styling skills (of course I will continue to learn new things and attempt to stay ahead of the curve with new programs and ways of doing things) and I'm okay with JavaScript (I did buy the "JavaScript for Dummies" from Barnes and Nobles about two weeks ago and I've begun to go through it.</p>
                <p>I've done many things in my life, some good, some bad. Signing up for this course and begining to learn coding... it's been the best decision I've ever made. I won't say "I wish I'd done it earlier, since I wasn't ready for it back then, but right now, in my life, I could eat, sleep, and breathe coding and be perfectly content. I love every second of school and when I'm studying or working on some practice code it honestly doesn't feel like work to me. I'm sure eventually the novelty of it all will begin to wear off, like most things in life, but for right now, I am content.</p>
                <p>So onto our first problem => solution... I wanted to build my second page (aboutMe) to be an embedded version of my resume plus a nav section to my other projects (I do have my first one in the works, a coworker wants to hire me to develop her personal website, a tracker of sorts to journal her weight loss journey) and I was having issues on finding out how to embedd the .docx file. Eventually, I found my way to a stackoverflow thread (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5565759/how-to-embed-a-document-in-html-page) and I was able to find what I was looking for. Using the 'embed' tag, and saving the .docx to a .pdf, I was able to embed the file and then style it to my satisfaction. It's not the prettiest (the 'embed) tag comes with some tools and what-not around the embedded file. But it works for now. An 'iframe' and 'object' tags would have worked as well. </p>
